Introduction to Test Driven Development
=======================================

What is TDD?
------------
Test Driven Development is a programming practice that combines Test First Development and Refactoring. This means that when we want to extend our program, we first write a failing unit test, write code to make the test pass, and then refactor.

Let's look at each of these steps in a little more detail.

**Write a failing unit test**  
For our purposes, a unit test is a small piece of code that verifies the behavior of a method in the class under test. Before we can write this test code we need to know what behavior we want to add and which class and method it will initially live in. 
**Make the test pass**  
**Refactor**
